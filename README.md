	🚧  Weather Ease 🚀 Building...  🚧
</h4>

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Clone this repository
```bash
# clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yandrakarine/weather-ease

# Navigate to the project folder
cd weather-ease

```
## Step 2: Installing dependencies

Now you need to install all the necessary depedencies for the project by running the following command:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn
```

## Step 3: Start the Metro Server

You will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of Weather Ease App project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 4: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your **Weather Ease App**. :partying_face:

# Troubleshooting

If you can't get this to work, see the [Troubleshooting](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting) page.

# Userful methods

## Checking TypeScript
We check TypeScript every commit, but you can check it in isolation by running the following command:

```bash
yarn test:tsc
```

## Commits
In this project we followed the [Git Flow](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-flow) commits pattern, to help us in the process we used [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)
```bash
yarn commit
```

## Running unit tests
We've added some unit tests for utility functions. You can run them using the following command:


```bash
# run all of them
yarn test

# run for a specific file
yarn test 'fileRelativePath'
```
